## Goal

Goal of this notebook is to gain insights into data jobs in the US.

In this notebook we explore a dataset of different business analyst jobs. We want to know where the most jobs are, and which pay the best, also we'd like to find out which industry has the highest demand for data jobs.

We found the most jobs are in the NY and SF regions, with another hotspot in South Central US. Business Systems Analyst is the best paying job on average, beating other job titles on every quartile. Finally we found that the IT sector has the highest demand for data jobs, which makes sense because data and IT are very closely intertwined.
